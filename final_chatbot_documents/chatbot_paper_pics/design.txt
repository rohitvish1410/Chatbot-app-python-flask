The designing and development of this system can be divided into three major domains- Web development, Natural Language Processing based software development and IoT. The first domain refers to a website/webpage developed for the UI (User Interface). A python program provided with a pre-requisite restaurant dataset/database, to train the bot based on NLTK (Natural Language tool kit), is linked to this webpage using ‘Flask’ framework of python which is used to link python programs to webpages to display results on them and vice-versa. This framework was chosen by us over the more popular and preferred ‘Django’ framework, simply because of its easier syntax and lesser complexity. The third domain refers to the connectivity to the ‘Hardware bot’ which works on the principles of IoT (Internet of Things). The bot, on receiving an order, follows a path up to the kitchen, waits for a certain interval of time and then brings the order back at the customer’s table.
