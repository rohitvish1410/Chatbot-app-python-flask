We may debate which country invented pizza, but there's no denying that it's one of the most popular foods found throughout the world. The word pizza, which comes from the word pita, means 'pie.' So be careful: calling it a pizza pie is sort of like saying "I'll have the soup de jour of the day." The below list is by no means exhaustive. It's just meant to drop a little knowledge on you about some of the more popular permutations found in different regions of the world.

1. Lahma Bi Ajeen
This scrumptious version of pizza, which literally translates into "meat with dough," is brought to you by the Lebanese (other parts of the Middle East call it by other names) and is made with minced onions, usually ground lamb, cumin and yogurt. If you have never tried it, you really must! Soo delicious.

2. Margherita
The pizza Margherita is just over a century old and is named after HM Queen Margherita of Italy, wife of King Umberto I and first Queen of Italy. It's made using toppings of tomato, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil, which represent the red, white, and green of the Italian flag.

3. Calzone
Calzone means 'stocking' in Italian and is a turnover that originates from Italy. Shaped like a semicircle, the calzone is made of dough folded over and filled with the usual pizza ingredients.

4. Stromboli
Many people think that strombolis and calzones are identical. However, this is not really the case. According to WIKI, "there are several theories regarding the origin of the stromboli. Romano's Italian Restaurant & Pizzeria claims to have originated it in 1950 in Essington, Tinicum Township, just outside of Philadelphia, by Nazzareno Romano. Others claim a stromboli sandwich with chili sauce was invented by Mike Aquino, Sr., in Spokane, Washington, named after the movie Stromboli starring Ingrid Bergman, in 1954."

5. Marinara
This is your basic flat bread with oil, tomato, garlic, and oregano. In Italy, back in the old days, it was stored on voyages so that sailors (marinai) could make pizza away from home.

6. Neapolitan
The Neapolitan hails from Naples and is the basis for our modern-day American pizza. Originally, the Neapolitan pie was served sans cheese. But around 1889, that seems to have changed when the Royal Palace commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. That's how the plain pizza morphed into the Margherita.

7. Deep Dish
Unlike most pizzas, deep dish is eaten with a knife and fork. It hails from Chicago and the best story I found about its origin comes from an article dating back to 1943 from the Chicago Tribune:

Chicago-style pizza may owe its existence to a bad enchilada. When partners Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo planned to open a restaurant, Sewell, a native Texan, wanted to feature Mexican food. But one of the sample meals the partners tested made Riccardo so sick that he rejected Mexican food entirely. Riccardo suggested pizza, which he had encountered in Italy--as indeed many American servicemen were doing during World War II. Sewell's complaint with pizza was that it was insubstantial, little more than an appetizer--and readily available in Chicago's Little Italy neighborhood besides. Sewell wanted a substantial, meal-size pizza.

THE TOP 10 INDIAN DISHES
Masala Chai
by Jeannie Mark

Indian cuisine is continually put on foodie lists all over the world and no wonder, with the variety of flavors and regions, Indian food is vastly diverse, and not to mention delicious!

If you are an Indian food newbie, here are some dishes that will have you sounding like an expert.

1 – ALU GOBI
The Top 10 Indian Dishes Alu Gobi
 

Alu Gobi is a dry dish made with potatoes (aloo), cauliflower (gobi) and Indian spices. It is yellowish in color, due to the use of turmeric, and occasionally contains kalonji and curry leaves. Other common ingredients include garlic, ginger, onion, coriander stalks, tomato, peas, and cumin. It all adds up to one of the most popular dishes ordered in Indian restaurants.

2 – BUTTER CHICKEN
The Top 10 Indian Dishes Butter Chicken
 

Butter chicken is traditionally cooked in a tandoor; but may be grilled, roasted or pan-fried in less authentic preparations. The gravy is made by first heating fresh tomato, garlic, and cardamom into a bright red pulp, which is then pureed after cooling, then the chef adds butter, Khoa and various spices, often including asafoetida, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, fenugreek and fresh cream. Did you know it originated in the 1950s, in the kitchens of Moti Mahal in Daryaganj, Delhi? A fun fact you can share with friends.



3 – ROGAN JOSH
The Top 10 Indian Dishes rogan josh
 

Rogan josh (or roghan josh) is a staple of Kashmiri cuisine: originally it was brought to Kashmir by the Mughals. It is one of the main dishes of the Kashmiri multi-course meal (the “Wazwan”). It consists of braised lamb chunks cooked with a gravy based on browned onions or shallots, yogurt, garlic, ginger and aromatic spices (cloves, bay leaves, cardamom and cinnamon). Its characteristic brilliant red color traditionally comes from liberal amounts of dried Kashmiri chillies that have been de-seeded to reduce their heat: these chillies are considerably milder than the typical dried cayenne chillies of Indian cuisine. The recipe’s spiciness is one of fragrance rather than heat, and the dish is mild enough to be appreciated by western palates that may not be use to spicy tastes. If you love lamb, this is a must eat dish.

4 – SAMOSAS
The Top 10 Indian Dishes samosas
 

Samosas are a fried or baked pastry with savoury filling, such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, lentils and sometimes ground lamb, ground beef or ground chicken. They were introduced to India during the Muslim Delhi Sultanate when cooks from the Middle East and Central Asia migrated to work in the kitchens of the Sultan and the nobility. Indian samosas are usually vegetarian, and often accompanied by a mint sauce or chutney. Samosas are a common street food and many tourists or Indians eat them as a midday snack.

5 – TANDOORI CHICKEN
The Top 10 Indian Dishes Chicken Tandori
 

Tandoori chicken a popular North Indian dish consisting of roasted chicken prepared with yogurt and spices. The name comes from the type of cylindrical clay oven, a tandoor, in which the dish is traditionally prepared. The chicken is marinated in yogurt and seasoned with the spice mixture tandoori masala. Cayenne pepper, red chili powder or Kashmiri red chili powder is used to give it a fiery red hue. This dish goes so well with steaming basmati rice and crispy naan.

6 – MALAI KOFTA
The Top 10 Indian Dishes Malai Kofta
 

Malai Kofta is a tasty vegetarian alternative. Restaurant style malai kofta is cooked in a creamy gravy made of tomatoes and cashew nuts. Malai actually means, “cream” and both the kofta and the sauce literally melts in your mouth. A heavenly dish that soaks up rice nicely.

7 – MASALA CHAI
The Top 10 Indian Dishes Masala Chai
 

There’s nothing like the experience of stopping a Chai Wallah on the street and ordering a steaming cup of masala chai when in India. Made by brewing black tea with a mixture of aromatic spices and herbs. The beverage has gained worldwide popularity, becoming a feature in many coffee and teahouses. Traditionally it is prepared by a decoction of green cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, ground cloves, ground ginger, and black peppercorn together with black tea leaves, In international tea shops, it’s often sold in a tea bag form, with a variety of revolving recipes, but once combined with steaming hot milk, it’s delicious all around, whether found in India or your hometown.

8 – MATAR PANEER
The Top 10 Indian Dishes Matar Paneer
 

Matar Paneer is a vegetarian north Indian dish consisting of peas and farmer’s cheese (paneer) in a tomato based sauce and spiced with garam masala. It is often served with rice, naan, paratha, poori, or roti (depending on the region). Most lovers of this dish recommend dipping whatever bread is accompanying the meal into the delicious tomato gravy.



9 – NAAN
The Top 10 Indian Dishes Naan
 

Naan is a leavened, oven-baked flatbread that’s normally served with all meals. Typically, it will be served hot and brushed with ghee or butter. In non-traditional circles, different varieties of naan are available, like garlic naan or cheese naan. However you eat it, naan acts as almost a spoon to soup up sauce or dipped into chutneys. An Indian meal isn’t complete without naan at its side.

10 – BEEF VINDALOO
The Top 10 Indian Dishes Beef vindaloo
 

Vindaloo itself is a curry dish popular in the region of Goa. It is known globally in its Anglo-Indian form as a staple of curry house menus, often regarded as a fiery spicy dish, though it is not necessarily the hottest dish around. A variety of meats can become a vindaloo dish such as lamb or chicken, but beef vindaloo is one of the most popular versions. A vindaloo paste can be a blend of chillies with cumin, coriander and other authentic spices. Traditionally a very hot curry with tomatoes, onions and of course loads of chillies, but many Indian restaurants ease down the hotness, by adding less chillies. If you want a bit of fire in your mouth, order this dish!

There is truly a long catalogue of scrumptious Indian cuisine, but these ten should get anyone curious about this delightful cuisine started on the path to gastronomy heaven.
